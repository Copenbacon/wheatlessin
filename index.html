            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
            <h3>When is our inaugural launch day?</h3>
            <p>Spring of 2017.</p>
            <h3>What is gluten?</h3>
            <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in grains like wheat, rye, spelt, and barley. Of the gluten-containing grains, wheat is the most commonly consumed. The two main proteins in gluten are called glutenin and gliadin. When flour is mixed with water, the gluten proteins form a sticky network that has a glue-like element. This element makes dough elastic and gives bread the ability to rise when baked.</p>
            <h3>What is “Gluten Free” vs. “Certified Gluten-Free”?</h3>
            <p>Food establishments like restaurants and bakeries can prepare certain items on their menu gluten free and may certainly be doing everything they can to accommodate a gluten allergy. This means the order was prepared gluten free but may have been unintentionally cross contaminated with other gluten items. Certified Gluten-Free is a non-profit agency that helps businesses comply to a stricter code (zero contamination) when preparing gluten free foods so that medically the food can be safely consumed. It is the gold standard to gluten free! You may have already seen this logo shown below on food packages and restaurant websites.</p>
            <h3>Does the site only focus on wheatless foods and products?</h3>
            <p>No, our focus is everything that contains gluten (wheat, barley, &amp; rye) and help the community discover gluten free including certified gluten-free.</p>
